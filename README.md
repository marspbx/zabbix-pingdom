# About this project
This project came up with a need in my company, we needed to integrate Zabbix with Pingdom to collect the status and response time of items registered within Pingdom and thus do all data processing, graphics, and alerts. 
For this it was necessary to develop a script in python 3, a template for Zabbix to collect data with LLD Discovery and data processing via json path
